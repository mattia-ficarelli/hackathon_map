The solution to the Multiverse Hackathon: Finding the best location to open a company’s first operational facility.

The CTO of an on-demand delivery start-up based in Greater London is looking to open the company’s first operational facility. The company uses a fleet of electric scooters to provide a “last-mile” delivery service to Fortune 500 companies in the city. The executive sponsor has asked you to make a recommendation about where to open the first location, based on the following criteria:

- Location with the lowest rent.
- Within the London ultra-low emission zone.
- 20 minutes from both the City and Canary Warf.

In order to solve the business case a folium map of London was generated. Our solution won 1st prize.
